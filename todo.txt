# TODO



Method: 
- Fix POP section 
- Agent conflict "resolution" and agent communication
- Fix overall structure

Shortcomings:
- Not being able to allocate resources to get help moving boxes

Experimenting:
- Insert part about competition - comment on data structure used here


Future:
- Agent communication (move part from methods)

- Total re-planning

- "Planned subtasks that agents cannot carry out themselves need to be reallocated"
