abstract = {Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents, Cambridge University Press, 2010, is a book about the science of artificial intelligence (AI). It presents artificial intelligence as the study of the design of intelligent computational agents. The book is structured as a textbook, but it is accessible to a wide audience of professionals and researchers. In the last decades we have witnessed the emergence of artificial intelligence as a serious science and engineering discipline. This book provides the first accessible synthesis of the field aimed at undergraduate and graduate students. It provides a coherent vision of the foundations of the field as it is today. It aims to provide that synthesis as an integrated science, in terms of a multi-dimensional design space that has been partially explored. As with any science worth its salt, artificial intelligence has a coherent, formal theory and a rambunctious experimental wing. The book balances theory and experiment, showing how to link them intimately together. It develops the science of AI together with its engineering applications.},

@article{VanderKrogt2005,
abstract = {In most practical situations, agents need to continuously improve or repair their plans. In a multiagent system agents also need to coordinate their plans. Consequently, we need methods such that agents in a multiagent system can construct, coordinate, and repair their plans. In this paper we focus on the problem of coordinating plans without exchanging explicit information on de- pendencies, or having to construct a global set of constraints. Our approach is to combine a propositional plan repair algorithm for each agent with a blackboard that auctions subgoals on behalf of the agents. Both the details of a first construc- tion and some initial experimental results are discussed.},

abstract = {Distributed SIPE (DSIPE) is a distributed planning system that provides decision support to human planners in a collaborative planning environment. The key contributions of our research on DSIPE are (1) constraint-based, consistent local views of the global plan that give each planner a view of how other planners' subplans relate to their local planning decisions; (2) methods for automatically identifying and sharing potentially relevant information among distributed planning agents; and (3) techniques for merging subplans that leverage the shared subplan structure to generate a complete, final plan. DSIPE is a fully implemented system and has been demonstrated to end users in the maritime (United States Navy and United States Marine Corps) planning community.},

@inproceedings{Nguyen2001,
abstract = {This paper challenges the prevailing pessimism about the scalability of partial order planning (POP) algorithms by presenting several novel heuristic control techniques that make them competitive with the state of the art plan synthesis algorithms. Our key insight is that the techniques responsible for the efficiency of the currently successful planners-viz., distance based heuristics, reachability analysis and disjunctive constraint handling-can also be adapted to dramatically improve the efficiency of the POP algorithm. We implement our ideas in a variant of UCPOP called REPOP1. Our empirical results show that in addition to dominating UCPOP, REPOP also convincingly outperforms Graphplan in several "parallel" domains. The plans generated by REPOP also tend to be better than those generated by Graphplan and state search planners in terms of execution flexibility.},
