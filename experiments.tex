The planning problem was approached from two different angles, that were intended to be merged later. The two approaches were partial order planning and hierarchical task network. "[!Ref:]" 


\subsection{POP}

\textbf{Experimenting with back-tracking}

It was attempted to implement a back-tracking algorithm ....

\subsection{HTN}





\subsection{General} 


\textbf{Experimenting with heuristics}

Weighted heuristics to encourage specific moves





\textbf{Experiments with search strategy}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item BFS 
    \item Multi queue BFS (Maybe IDA* or Iterative deepening search)
\end{enumerate}



Benchmarking the multi queue BFS against standard BFS:





\subsection{Preprocessing}
Experimenting with preprocessing and ``All goals shortest path'' 
- Part of the POP algorithm

- POP run after each solved goal 
--> Better solution --> SO much slower





\subsection{Results}
