20 second run 

BFS:

[Client said] Search starting with strategy Best-first Search (PriorityQueue) using A* evaluation
[Client said] #Explored:    0, #Frontier:   1, Time: 0.00 s     [Used: 291.41 MB, Free: 316.59 MB, Alloc: 608.00 MB, MaxAlloc: 7282.00 MB]

[Client said] #Explored: 79000, #Frontier: 11774, Time: 20.33 s     [Used: 893.79 MB, Free: 727.21 MB, Alloc: 1621.00 MB, MaxAlloc: 7282.00 MB]


Multi queue BFS:

[Client said] Search starting with strategy Best-first Search (PriorityQueue) using A* evaluation
[Client said] #Explored:    0, #Frontier:   1, Time: 0.00 s     [Used: 260.84 MB, Free: 219.66 MB, Alloc: 480.50 MB, MaxAlloc: 7282.00 MB]

[Client said] #Explored: 256978, #Frontier: 198642, Time: 20.47 s   [Used: 4007.45 MB, Free: 1369.05 MB, Alloc: 5376.50 MB, MaxAlloc: 7282.00 MB]


\textbf{Analysis}
From the results it is very clear that the multi queue BFS strategy explores more states than BFS. However, the memory consumption is also a great deal higher. Of course this is mainly due to the size of the frontiers combined, which counts over 10 times more than the BFS strategy.
