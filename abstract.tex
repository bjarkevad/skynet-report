In this paper we propose a solution to problems in a domain consisting of sets of agents, goal-cells and -boxes in a static, fully observable environment,
Our approach is to use a Planner based on Least Commitment planning, where we look into optimization techniques, perform analysis of benchmarks, as well provide results from running the planner on actual levels in the domain.
We conclude that, while our planner does indeed perform quite well, there's still room improvement --- especially when multiple agents are involved.

% Throughout this paper the SkyNet AI \& MAS will be explained. Also findings on different methods which was used to optimize the algorithm, both regarding time optimization and optimal solution. Here data structure comes into play when regarding time, but also heuristics and other topics.
