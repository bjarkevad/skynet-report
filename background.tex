For solving a problem in the hospital domain Partial Order Planning (POP) and Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) is used. At the time of the competition POP used Multi Queue Best First Search \cite{hector2013a} (MQBFS) is used in a naive implementation. \par
The MQBFS is a way to use multiple queues to explore states, normally these queues are divided into a helpful and a non-helpful list. The algorithm then alternates between the two queues, using the node with the lowest heuristics. This also means that the heuristic is calculated when a node is expanded, which results in a smaller overhead of heuristics. \par
Another thing used is a global goal order constraint, where the order of the goals is split into two.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is the goal blocking for another goal, using the initial state as offset for calculation
	\item The length of the solution of each goal
\end{enumerate}
This allows for goals to be ordered before it is split into partial plans using POP.
