\subsection{POP}

- Relaxed problem --> Only one goal, box and agents

- Picking a specific box for a goal
- Relies heavily on the goal order being correct and chosen boxes being correct

\subsection{Multi-agent} 

The implementation of the multi agent client  .... 



The goals are ordered with regards to whether or not they disrupt or conflict with other subgoal plans \cref{sect:subgoal_pop}. As the planning is executed sequentially in the determined goal order, and not concurrently, the communication between agents and determination of ``who is right'' can be simplified. 
If an agent moves a box or occupies a cell at a given time, it is the other agents responsibility to comply with this and either wait or do something else. However, this practice relies on that the determined goal order is correct possible to complete. 

The communication is simply done by letting the agents announce which cells they occupy at a given time in the plan as well as which box they move, if any.
