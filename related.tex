In \cite{VanderKrogt2005}, Roman and Mathijs sets up a goal for a multi-agent system:
\say{Our goal is a system in which \textit{self-interested} agents can \textit{(i)} construct and \textit{repair plans}, \textit{(ii)} \textit{coordinate} their actions, and do so while \textit{(iii)} maintaining their \textit{privacy}.}

Maintaining privacy per se, is not applicable in our domain, but doing so would decrease the size of state-space, 
making exploration much less resource intensive. 
This would of course mean that we would have to implement a plan-repair algorithm, that fits the new problem.
By not having every agent share every detail with every agent, we would reduce the risk combinatorial explosion to some extent.

What is interesting in \cite{VanderKrogt2005}, is the use of plan-repair as a way of coordinating agents, i.e. the only central place of communication is the plain-repair algorithm.
