% - Our solution

The use cases for artificial intelligence (AI) has been steadily increasing, as computers have gotten faster, smaller and widely available.
Lately AI has seen a lot of use in Big Data, as it can provide some very intelligent analysis and key-insight.\cite{OLeary2013},
but still sees a lot of use in more traditional domains, such as robotics.

We apply this to a simplified domain, consisting of a deterministic environment (also called levels), a set of goals (a pair of a goal-cell and a box that should reach this cell), and agents that can accomplish these goals.
This simplification can be, more or less, mapped directly to more concrete cases --- 
whether its a purely software implementation, such as AI in a video game, or a software-hardware mix, in such case as robotics.

In this paper we discuss our different approaches and experiments, as well as show some intermediary results.

Later on we present a solution based on Partial Order (also called Least Commitment), Planning, 
which allows us to solve a variety of different levels. 

% The goal of SkyNet is to try to find a way to solve a planning problem in a set domain. The domain is to simulate robots transporting, blood samples, medicine, beds, medical equipment, food, garbage, etc. By employing robots for transporting tasks, human resources can be freed to follow other tasks. \par
