The amount use cases for artificial intelligence (AI) has been steadily increasing, as computers have gotten faster, smaller and widely available. \citep{sabhnani2011a}
Lately AI has seen a lot of use in Big Data, as it can provide some very intelligent analysis and key-insights \citep{OLeary2013},
but still sees a lot of use in more traditional domains, such as robotics.

We apply AI to a traditional, simplified domain with the informal name ``Block World'', consisting of a deterministic environment (also called levels), a set of goals (a pair of a goal-cell, and a box that should reach this cell), and agents that can accomplish these goals.
This simplification can be, more or less, mapped directly to more concrete cases --- 
whether its a purely software implementation, such as AI in a video game, or a software-hardware mix, in such case as robotics.

In this paper we discuss our different approaches and experiments, as well as show some intermediary results.

Later on we present a solution based on Partial Order (also called Least Commitment), Planning, 
which allows us to solve a variety of different levels.
